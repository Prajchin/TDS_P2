# **Project: Automated Data Analysis and Visualization**

## **Overview**
- This project uses a Python script to analyze, visualize, and narrate a story from a CSV dataset.
- It leverages both Python and an LLM (GPT-4o-Mini) to dynamically explore datasets and generate insights.

---

## **Features**
1. **Dynamic Dataset Handling**
   - Accepts any valid CSV file as input.
   - Handles missing values, diverse data types, and large datasets.

2. **Automated Analysis**
   - Summarizes the dataset with key metrics:
     - Data types.
     - Missing and unique values.
     - Statistical summaries.
   - Performs exploratory data analysis:
     - Correlations.
     - Outlier detection.
     - Clustering and trends.

3. **Visualizations**
   - Generates 1â€“3 supporting charts in PNG format:
     - Correlation heatmaps.
     - Scatter plots.
     - Trend analyses.

4. **Narrative Generation**
   - Uses the LLM to generate a Markdown-based story:
     - Dataset description.
     - Key findings and insights.
     - Implications and recommendations.
